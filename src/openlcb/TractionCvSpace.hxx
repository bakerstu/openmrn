/// Memory Space implementation for a CV (configuration variable) access on a

/// Restrictions: the DCC locmotives are required to have theid NodeID

/// assumption that node IDs lower, than 128 are shoprt addresses, and higher

///
/// @TODO(balazs.racz) Wire up a link to the traction service to somehow remove
