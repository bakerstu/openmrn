/// FlashFile is a driver for a single file that is backed by flash.
/// Instantiations may use serial flash (using SPIFlash) or internal flash.

/// There are limitations on writes.
///
/// - A sequential write of the file with no seeks from the beginning to the
///   end will work. Whenever the first byte of a sector is written, the entire
///   sector will be erased.
///
/// - If the file is opened with O_TRUNC, then all sectors of the file are
///   erased.
///
/// - The file does not remember its size. fstat always returns the maximum
