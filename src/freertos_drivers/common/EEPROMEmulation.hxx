/** Emulates EEPROM in FLASH for the Tiva, LPC17xx and LPC40xx
 * platforms. Applicable in general to any microcontroller with self-writeable
 * flash.
 *
 * Theory of operation:
 *
 * The EEPROM area is an area of the MCU Flash reserved for the EEPROMEmulation
 * driver. This area must fall onto flash erase boundaries. The driver will
 * perform a journal of every write into this flash area by writing (offset,
 * data) pairs in append mode. Reads will scan through the journal to find the
 * desired data. When the journal gets full, the data is copied to a second
 * flash area, compacting data by keeping overwrites only once, and then the
 * original area is erased.
 *
 * Specifics and parameters:
 *
 * The flash area is specified by the linker symbols __eeprom_start and
 * __eeprom_end. It is the responsibility of the memory map linker script to
 * align these at flash erase boundaries. Inside this area there are
 * independently eraseable sectors. The requirement is that at least two
 * independently eraseable sectors be present, in order to allow copying data
 * from one sector to another without endangering data loss due to power
 * interruption.
 *
 * The layout of each sector is the following: the sector is split into blocks,
 * where each block can be independently written. Each block will be written
 * only once between two erase operations. The first few blocks are reserved
 * for tracking the state of the sector, the rest of the blocks are used as
 * slots holding data payload. The sectors go through the following states (in
 * order):
 *  1) erased. When the sector is all 0xFF.
 *  2) dirty. The data is being copied over into this sector.
 *  3) intact. This sector contains all the data.
 *  4) used. This sector contains old data and can be reused after erasing.
 *
 * The layout of a slot is very simple: the first two bytes hold the
 * address. The lower two bytes of each 4-byte hold the data payload.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  @param SECTOR_SIZE: size of independently erased flash areas. Usually in
 *  the range of kilobytes; for example somewhere between 1-16 kbytes.
 *  @param EEPROMEMU_FLASH_SIZE: Automatically detected from the linker symbols.
 *  An integer (at least 2) multiple of SECTOR_SIZE. Sectors within the
 *  designatedflash are will be used in a round-robin manner to maximize flash
 *  endurance.
 *  @param BLOCK_SIZE: Defines how many bytes shall be flashed in one
 *  operation. Usually a small integer, at least 4, defined by the hardware
 *  limitations of the MCU flash (for example on the NXP 17xx it is 16 bytes,
 *  because programming less than 16 bytes in one go is not supported).
 *  @param BYTES_PER_BLOCK: how many bytes of actual data should be stored in a
 *  block. Must be <= BLOCK_SIZE - 2 (in order to leave space for the address
 *  in the block). Must be a power of two.
 *  @param SHADOW_IN_RAM: a boolean, if set to true, a shadow_ memory are will
 *  be allocated in RAM that will be pre-filled with the entire eeprom
 *  data. Dramatically speeds up reads, because reads will not have to go
 *  through the log anymore.
 *  @param file_size: The total number of bytes held by the emulated eeprom
 *  file. Reads from address 0 .. file_size - 1 will be valid. Must be smaller
 *  than half of one sector, but should be realistically about 35% of the
 *  sector size to avoid too frequent sector erasing.
 *
 * Limitations:
 *
 * At any point in time there is only one active sector. This means that all
 * useful data has to fit in one sector. This limits the max number of bytes to
 * be sector_size / 2. To work around this is makes sense to set the eepromemu
 * sector size to be a multiple of what the microcontroller can erase in one
 * go, and writing the flash_erase in a way that just erases all flash sectors
 * that fall into the chosen eepromemu sector.
 *
 * Since there is only one active sector, it makes fairly little sense to have
 * more than two sectors in total. One spare sector is needed for copying data
 * over in a power-failure-safe manner. More than two sectors will not extend
 * the size of available eepromemu space, just round-robin with using the flash
 * sectors, thereby extending flash lifetime -- which already should not be a
 * problem on modern MCUs.
 *
 * The efficiency is not great: only 25% of the allocated flash space can be
 * used for data storage. Users should leave some additional buffer to avoid
 * too frequent overflowing of sectors.
 *
 * The file size is limited to 64k - BLOCK_SIZE because the address is stored
 * on 2 bytes in each block.
