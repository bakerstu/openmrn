/** Emulates EEPROM in SPI-FLASH for the CC32xx platform.
 *
 * Theory of operation:
 *
 * We use one device file per sector. A sector, when erased, will start the
 * file fresh and empty, in a read-write mode. The file will be in read-write
 * mode until the device reboots. Upon the next boot, the files are opened in a
 * read-only mode, and the available() value is set to zero. This will force
 * upon the first write a new sector to be erased and all data to be copied
 * over to it.
 *
 * When the EEPROM driver wants to read a block, we load the data from the file
 * into an in-memory cache, and return a pointer into that cache. This is how
 * we map the file into memory. Fortunately we receive a call before the driver
 * needs a different block, so we get a chance to update the memory mapped
 * region.
 *
 * One major difference is that there is no way to write the "used" block to
 * the past file when the data has been copied over to the new sector. In spite
 * of this we are using a different scheme for the used magic, and fake the
 * writing of the used magic when data is loaded into the cache. The USED magic
 * is virtually set for every sector except the sector last erased that has
 * INTACT data. When we erase a sector we write a "rotation number" to the USED
 * magic offset. The rotation number is incremented every time we jump from
 * sector N-1 to sector 0. This way we can determine upon boot which sector was
 * last erased.
