/** Flash-backed file.
 *
 * The memory in flash for this file has to be reserved by the linker
 * script. Any read operations will do just memcpy from the reserved pointer to
 * the application buffer. Doing direct reads from flash using the reserved
 * pointer is also valid.
 *
 * Only sequential writes are supported. This means that opening the file for
 * write, and writing from the beginning until the end is okay, but any other
 * write access is not guaranteed to work.
 *
 * Specifically, a flash page will be erased if and only if the first byte of
 * that page is being written. */
