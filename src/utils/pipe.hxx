/** A generalized pipe that allows connecting an arbitrary number of
   endpoints.

   Data sent by any endpoint will be received by all other endpoints. A special
   case of this (for two endpoints) is a regular pipe.

   Use-cases:

   1) A software interface can export a hardware device (with a device node
   path such as /dev/virtualUSB0). This is the use-case of a normal 2-way pipe,
   which allows protocol encapsulation without modifying lower-level code. For
   example it will be possible to create a stream over CAN packets for
   debugging output and export that stream as a device that can be opened as fd
   1 and 2 (stdout and stderr). This won't need any device drivers to be
   written.


   2) Creating multiple virtual CANbus adapters that send and receive traffic
   from the same physical bus, as if there were multiple physical adapters
   connected to the same wires.

   One great use of this is to attach alternate CANbus handlers to the device
   that normally OpenMRN library code reads.  There can be other traffic
   coexisting on the CANbus next to OpenLCB packets.  This traffic will have to
   be consumed by non-OpenMRN code, and will need its own reader thread.  It is
   not possible however to open the same device (e.g. /dev/can0) again, because
   that means that every packet will go to either the OpenMRN library code, or
   the application-specific code.  By creating a Pipe, adding the physical
   CANbus device to it and two virtual device nodes, it is possible to
   duplicate every incoming packet, route it to the appropriate handlers
   wihtout the handler code being aware of whether it is talking to a physical
   or virtual device. As a bonus, the handlers can talk to each other.

   Another use of this facility is for testing purposes, where multiple OpenMRN
   devices can be run, each with their own set of virtual nodes, on the same
   CANbus. They will be talking to each other as if it was different physical
   nodes (assuming te code is bug-free).

   A third use of this configuration is to create a "packet logger", where the
   OpenMRN node would capture all the trafic on the CANbus and log it to a host
   computer on a separate interface (e.g. USB port). This avoids the need for a
   separate CANbus sniffer.


   3) A CANbus 'hub'.

   It is possible to add multiple physical devices to the same Pipe, which is a
   software-equivalent of connecting the wires together. All packets coming in
   on one bus will be copied to the other bus and vice versa. This allows to
   overcome the limitations of segment length or to bridge buses running at
   different speeds (at the expense of packet loss if the faster bus is
   saturated).

   It remains possible to add a virtual device to the same pipe and run OpenMRN
   stack on it.


   Example code:

   in hw_init.cxx

   DEFINE_PIPE(can_pipe0, sizeof(struct can_frame));
   VIRTUAL_DEVTAB_ENTRY(canp0v0, can_pipe0, "/dev/canp0v0", 16);
   VIRTUAL_DEVTAB_ENTRY(canp0v1, can_pipe0, "/dev/canp0v1", 16);

   in main.cxx

   DECLARE_PIPE(can_pipe0);

   int appl_main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
     can_pipe0.AddPhysicalDeviceToPipe("/dev/can0", "can0_rx_thread", 512);
     can_pipe0.AddPhysicalDeviceToPipe("/dev/can1", "can1_rx_thread", 512);
     int fd = open("/dev/canp0v0", O_RDWR);
     PacketLogger::init(fd);
     nmranet_if = nmranet_can_if_init(0x02010d000000ULL, "/dev/canp0v1", read,
   write);
     ...regular code...
