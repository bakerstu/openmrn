/** Singleton class.

   By inheriting from this class you declare that the descendants will have
   only a single instance in the running binary. This will allow accessing the
   running instance without passing around a pointer to it.

   Usage:

   class Foo;

   class Foo: public Singleton<Foo> {
   ...as usual...
   };

   DEFINE_SINGLETON_INSTANCE(Foo);

   void appl_main() {
     Foo my_instance(constructor_args);
   }

   somewhere else:

   Foo::instance()->DoSomething();
 */
template <class T> class Singleton
{
public:
    Singleton()
    {
        HASSERT(instance_ == nullptr);
        instance_ = static_cast<T*>(this);
    }

    ~Singleton()
    {
        instance_ = nullptr;
    }

    static T* instance()
    {
        HASSERT(instance_ != nullptr);
        return instance_;
    }

private:
    static T* instance_;
};

#define DEFINE_SINGLETON_INSTANCE(T)                                           \
