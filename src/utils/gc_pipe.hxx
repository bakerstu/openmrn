     This function connects an ASCII (GridConnect-format) CAN adapter to a
     binary CAN adapter, performing the necessary format conversions
     inbetween.

     Specifically, it takes two Pipes as input, one carrying CAN frames in
     GridConnect protocol, and the other carrying CAN frames in the binary
     protocol.

     @param gc_side is the Pipe that has the ASCII GridConnect traffic.

     @param can_side is the Pipe that has the binary CAN traffic.

     @param double_bytes if true, any frame rendered into the GC protocol
     will have their characters doubled.

     @return a pointer to the created object. It can be deleted, which will
     terminate the link and unregister the link members from both pipes.
