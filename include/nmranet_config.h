 * @code
 * #include "nmranet_config.h"
 *
 * const char *nmranet_manufacturer = "Stuart W. Baker";
 * const char *nmranet_hardware_rev = "N/A";
 * const char *nmranet_software_rev = "0.1";
 * const size_t ALIAS_POOL_SIZE = 2;
 * const size_t DOWNSTREAM_ALIAS_CACHE_SIZE = 2;
 * const size_t UPSTREAM_ALIAS_CACHE_SIZE = 2;
