 * @section intro_section Introduction
 * OpenMRN is a networking stack specifically designed for use in model
 * model railroading.  The initial goal is to provide support for the NMRAnet
 * (http://www.nmranet.org) family of protocols which are based off of the
 * OpenLCB (http://www.openlcb.org) family of protocols.  NMRAnet protocols are
 * designed to be agnostic of the physical medium over which messages travel.
 * The OpenMRN provides support for multiple physical medium, such as CAN, while
 * abstracting physical medium specific details from the application layers.
 *
 * @section main_getting_started Getting Started Guide
 * See the @ref getting_started for instructions on setting up the tools and
 * running the example applications.
 *
 * @section main_user_api User API
 * See the @ref user_api page for direction on how an application can use the
 * stack.

 * release the source of bundled application code. The
 * maintainers and copyright holders of OpenMRN are not liable for misuse of
 * the FreeRTOS license.
 *
 * @subsection newlib_license Newlib License
 * OpenMRN uses Newlib (http://sourceware.org/newlib/) as a standard C library
 * for some target and OS combinations.  Newlib is a conglomeration of library
 * parts all under free software licenses
 * (http://sourceware.org/newlib/info.html).  Newlib can be used in a
 * commercial product without having to release the source of bundled
 * application code.  The maintainers and copyright holders of OpenMRN are not

 * @section layering Layering Model
 * The OpenMRN software is broken down into distinct layers of.  The lowest
 * layer is acutely aware of the physical medium and the individual frames of
 * data that pass over it.  As one moves up in the layers, the constructs
 * become more abstract and more object oriented.
 *

 *     a [shape=box label = "User API"];
 *     n [shape=record,label="{{<e> Event | <d> Datagram | <s> Stream} | <n> Node}"];

 *
 * @section threading Threading Model
 * An OpenMRN application always contains a minimum of one thread
 * of execution managed by an operating system.  In the case of FreeRTOS, an
 * OpenMRN application will also contain an @ref idle_thread and a
 * @ref timer_thread.  OpenMRN is designed to support
 * a number of different operating systems, and a thin abstraction is provided
 * in order to hide any OS specific differences.  The OS abstraction is
 * provided by @ref OS.hxx, and applications are encouraged to make use of when
 * accessing OS features such as threads, mutexes, semaphores, etc...
 *
 * @subsection main_thread Main Thread
 * The main thread is the thread of execution that os_main() is called with,
 * os_main() being the entry point of an application.
 * This thread is used for the application to initialize the stack.  Typically,
 * once any onetime initialization is complete, the OpenLCB stack inherits the
 * main thread for its own use with a SimpleCanStack::loop_executor() call.
 * 
 * @subsection timer_thread Timer Thread
 * FreeRTOS internally creates a thread for handling timers and events.  This
 * thread is managed by the RTOS and used by the RTOS.  It is not available for
 * application use.
 *
 * @subsection idle_thread Idle Thread
 * Some of the OS ports, such as FreeRTOS utilize an idle thread hook.  This
 * hook is used as a diagnostic tool to check the high water mark or each
 * thread's stack.  This can aid the developer in choosing the right stack size
 * for each thread as to not overflow their stack and minimize total RAM usage.
 *
 * @subsection additional_threads Additional Threads
 * An application may instantiate additional threads of its own using the
 * threading API found in OS.hxx.
 *
 * @subsection executor_service_stateflow Executors, Services, State Flows and Dispatch Flows
 * OpenMRN contains a further abstraction of the threading model, which is used
 * by the OpenLCB stack.  It is also available for application use and is
 * described on the @ref executor_service_stateflow_page page.
 *
 * @section hub_router_gateway Hubs, Routers, and Gateways
 * OpenMRN is designed to implement Hubs, Routers, and Gateways that can be
 * used to logically connect separate physical communications interfaces.  More
 * details can be found on the @ref hub_router_gateway_page page.
 *
 * @section coding_guidelines Coding Guidelines
 * OpenMRN source code adheres to very strict coding guidelines.  The
 * guidelines can be found in the @ref style_guide.
