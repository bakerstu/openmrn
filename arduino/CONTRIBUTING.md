# Contributing to OpenMRNLite

Thank you for considering to volunteer your time in making this software better.

**All changes must go to the [bakerstu/openmrn](https://github.com/bakerstu/openmrn) repository**

This is important, because the
[openmrn/OpenMRNLite](https://github.com/openmrn/OpenMRNLite) gets periodically
overwritten by the changes from upstream, and all changes to that repo will be
lost at the next release.

## Release process

is documented at https://github.com/bakerstu/openmrn/blob/master/arduino/RELEASE.md
